## pull-transcripts.py — timestamped transcripts for the podcast archive

Every file in `podcast-archive/` carries its transcript as timestamped paragraphs
(`**[41:12]** …`) so a line can be cited as `046 @ 41:12` and checked against the
audio in ten seconds. This script pulls or refreshes them:

```
python scripts/pull-transcripts.py podcast-archive/the-jesus-way/066-*.md   # a new episode
python scripts/pull-transcripts.py --only-missing podcast-archive/*/*.md    # anything not yet timestamped
```

It reads the YouTube link in each file's header, fetches the captions with
timestamps, and rewrites everything from `## Full Transcript` down, leaving the
synthesized header alone. With `APIFY_TOKEN` set it uses the Apify
`johnvc~YoutubeTranscripts` actor (a fraction of a cent per video, no throttling);
without it, `yt-dlp` (free, but YouTube rate-limits after a few videos).
`--lang es` for a non-English video. A video with captions disabled (episode 045)
needs audio plus a local Whisper; drop the segments into the cache in the same
shape and the script will format them.

Captions are pointers, not proof. Nothing the script writes is a source.

## semantic-search.py — search the whole collection by meaning

Keyword search (`grep`, GitHub search) only finds the words you already
thought of. This finds passages by *concept*:

```
python scripts/semantic-search.py "what did Jesus say about the kingdom being within?"
```

...and returns the most relevant passages across `christianity/`,
`gnosticism/`, `questions/`, `podcast-archive/`, `jesus-site-reference/`,
`extended-library/`, and the root orientation docs — ranked, with
`file:line` citations so you can go read the source.

### Every result carries its citation

Each hit prints the file's **provenance block** alongside the passage:

```
  1. [0.812]  christianity/Incoming/clementine-homilies-full-text.md:1852
     Section: Chapter XXXVIII — Corruption of the Law
     Source:  Attribution: Anonymous (traditionally attributed to Clement of
              Rome…) · Translation: Rev. Peter Peterson (Ante-Nicene Fathers
              Volume 8, 1886) — from the Greek · Source: ccel.org…
```

This is deliberate and it's the point. The indexer reads each file's source
header at index time and attaches it to every chunk, so **a passage cannot be
retrieved without its citation.** You never have to go hunting for where a
quote came from, and an AI assistant working from this repo can't hand you a
claim with the provenance stripped off.

Files with no source header report `(no source header — unverified
provenance)` instead. Missing provenance is meant to be loud. Three
conventions are recognized: a bold `**Translation:** …` block, a leading
blockquote `> Translation: …`, or a closing `*Sources: …*` bibliography line.
See CONTRIBUTING.md for the format.

**`Contributed by:` is read too**, so the person who brought material in
travels with it the same way the translator does — credit where it's earned,
and a name to ask when a citation needs checking.

### Setup

```bash
pip install google-genai chromadb
```

Then set a Google AI API key (get one at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey):

```powershell
# PowerShell — current session
$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-key-here"

# PowerShell — persist for future sessions
setx GOOGLE_API_KEY "your-key-here"
```

```bash
# bash / git-bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

The script exits immediately if `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is unset. Nothing else is
configured — no config file, no service to run.

Requires Python 3.12+. Dependencies are `google-genai` and `chromadb`;
everything else is stdlib.

### The three commands

**1. Build the index** (do this first, and again whenever content changes):

```bash
python scripts/semantic-search.py --rebuild
```

**2. Search:**

```bash
python scripts/semantic-search.py "blood atonement was not what Jesus taught"
python scripts/semantic-search.py "Ebionites and James" --top-k 10
python scripts/semantic-search.py "Nag Hammadi kingdom within" --full
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--top-k N` | Number of results (default 5) |
| `--full` | Print the entire matched chunk instead of a 200-char excerpt — useful for live lookups where you need the actual quote, not a teaser |

**3. Inspect the index:**

```bash
python scripts/semantic-search.py --stats
```

Prints the collection size plus chunk and file counts per top-level folder.

### What gets indexed

Every `*.md` file in the repo, except:

- `.git/`, `.claude/`, `.vector-db/`, `.venv/`, `node_modules/`,
  `__pycache__/`, `scripts/`
- `*.es.md` — the 17 Spanish mirrors in `jesus-site-reference/` are skipped,
  since they would return a duplicate hit alongside every English result
- binaries and site assets (`.pdf`, `.html`, `.png`, `.svg`, ...)

Current scope: **257 markdown files, ~16 MB, ~11,900 chunks.**

| folder | chunks (approx) |
|---|---|
| `podcast-archive/` | 8,050 |
| `christianity/` | 3,235 |
| `gnosticism/` | 241 |
| `jesus-site-reference/` | 194 |
| `questions/` | 145 |
| root `*.md` | 55 |
| `extended-library/` | 17 |

### How chunking works

Files are split on `#`/`##`/`###` headers, one chunk per section, 2000 chars
max per chunk, no overlap. Sections longer than 2000 chars are **split into
sequential parts** (labelled `header (part 2/14)`), not truncated — the
podcast transcripts run 100-700 KB per file with sparse headers, so
truncating would discard most of the corpus. Current coverage is ~99.9% of
all source characters.

Each result reports the chunk's starting line number in the source file.

### Rebuild cost and timing

- **Cold rebuild:** ~11,900 chunks in ~120 batches of 100. On a paid/billed
  API key expect roughly **10-20 minutes**. On a free-tier key the per-minute
  token limit will trigger 429 backoff — the script waits and retries
  automatically (5 attempts per batch, honoring the server's suggested
  retry delay), but a cold build can stretch to **well over an hour**.
  Progress prints per batch with a running ETA.
- **Incremental rebuild:** tracked by MD5 content hash per file in
  `.vector-db/file_metadata.json`. Re-running `--rebuild` after editing a
  handful of files only re-embeds those files (seconds), deletes their stale
  chunks first, and drops chunks for files that were deleted.
- **Interrupted rebuild:** safe to Ctrl-C. Progress is checkpointed every 10
  batches, chunk IDs are deterministic, and writes use `upsert`, so re-running
  `--rebuild` resumes rather than duplicating. If any batch fails outright the
  script says so and that file is retried on the next run.
- If the API rejects a batch for size reasons, lower `BATCH_SIZE` near the top
  of the script.

Embedding model: `gemini-embedding-001` at 768 dimensions.

### `.vector-db/` is a local build artifact

The index is written to `.vector-db/` at the repo root and is **gitignored —
never committed**. It is derived data: anyone can regenerate it with
`--rebuild` using their own API key. Don't try to share it; if you move
machines, just rebuild.

To start completely over, delete `.vector-db/` and run `--rebuild` again.

### Privacy note

Running `--rebuild` sends the text of every indexed file to Google's
embedding API, and each search sends your query. Everything committed to this
repo is intended to be public, so that's fine here.

**The indexer consults `.gitignore`, and that is the main safeguard.** Because a
rebuild uploads indexed text, "don't publish this" and "don't upload this" are
deliberately the same switch:

> If git won't push it, the indexer won't send it.

So you can keep a full in-copyright book in your own clone — gitignored,
readable by Obsidian and by an AI assistant locally — and it will never reach
the API. One line in `.gitignore` is the whole control. The run reports how
many files it skipped for this reason.

The repo-root `Incoming/` folder is belt-and-braces: gitignored *and* listed in
`SKIP_ROOT_DIRS`. The tracked primary-text folders — `christianity/Incoming/`,
`gnosticism/Incoming/`, `christianity/dead-sea-scrolls/Incoming/` — are *not*
affected and are indexed normally.

## import-kjv.py — the King James Bible, one verse per line

Imports the public-domain KJV (Project Gutenberg eBook #10) into
`christianity/Incoming/kjv/`, one file per book, every verse on its own line:

```
**9:13** But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: ...
```

Gutenberg's text wraps verses mid-sentence, which defeats exact-phrase search;
the import unwraps them so `grep -rn "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice"
christianity/Incoming/kjv/` lands on one line. Each file carries the repo's
provenance header, so the semantic index attaches "KJV, Project Gutenberg #10,
public domain" to every verse it returns.

```
python scripts/import-kjv.py             # downloads pg10.txt and writes 66 files + 00-README.md
python scripts/import-kjv.py pg10.txt    # from a local copy
```

Idempotent: re-running overwrites the same 66 files. The site build
(`site/build.py`) reads these files to stamp scripture citations HELD and to
show the verse text in the reader pane. Note for the semantic index: this adds
~4.5 MB of text (31,102 verses), so the next `--rebuild` is larger than before.
