# The Reading Room — the public front door

A static site that lets a stranger pull one of the `questions/` cards from a drawer, read the answer, and open every source behind it. No server, no AI, no account. Built from the repo on every merge to `main` and served at the project's GitHub Pages address.

**The design** came out of a round of mockups (Oct 2026): a night reading room, a card-catalog drawer that holds the *questions*, and a manila case file on the desk that holds the *evidence* for the pulled card, pinned FOR and AGAINST with red string. The catalog navigates; the case file argues. Charcoal and cream, with the string and one yellow legal pad as the only color.

## How it works

```
site/
├── data/cards/*.json   ← one structured record per questions/ card (hand-written, checked)
├── src/                ← index.html, styles.css, app.js (the room)
├── build.py            ← checks every source against the repo, writes dist/
└── dist/               ← build output (git-ignored; the Action builds it)
```

`build.py` is the honest part. For each source on a card:

| Source record | What the build does | Stamp |
|---|---|---|
| `"ref": "Matthew 9:13; 12:7"` + `"phrase"` | Resolves the verses in `christianity/Incoming/kjv/`, embeds the verse text, **fails if the phrase isn't in those verses** | HELD · KJV |
| `"path": "christianity/Incoming/didache-full-text.md"` + `"phrase"` | Greps the file, embeds a snippet around the hit, **fails if the phrase isn't there** | HELD |
| `"link": "https://…"` only | Nothing to check; links out | NOT YET HELD · public domain |

So a stamp on the site is a build result, never a hand-written claim, and the site cannot publish a citation the repo doesn't contain. When a public-domain text is added to the collection, change the source from `link` to `path` and the stamp turns green on the next build.

## Build locally

```
python site/build.py --check     # verify every citation, write nothing
python site/build.py             # write site/dist/
cd site/dist && python -m http.server 8000
```

## Adding a card

1. Copy an existing `site/data/cards/*.json`. Fill `question`, `aliases` (the ways people actually phrase it; this is what the drawer search matches), `finding` (the card's position, in the card's words), `oneLiners`, `doNotSay`, `sources`, `goDeeper`, `next`.
2. Every source has a `side` (`for`, `against`, `other`), a `tier` (the repo's source hierarchy, in words), a `note` (what the card says about it, including the response to an objection), and **one** of `ref` (scripture), `path` (a held repo file), or `link` (not held yet). Give `ref` and `path` sources a `phrase`: the distinctive words to grep.
3. Run `python site/build.py --check`. Fix anything it refuses.
4. The content must follow the card in `questions/`, not improve on it. The card is the reviewed artifact; the site is a view of it. If the card is wrong, fix the card first.

**Open decision (Matt + Rex):** whether these records should move into front-matter on the `questions/*.md` files themselves, so a contributor fixing a citation fixes the site in the same edit. The JSON folder is easy to migrate when that's settled.

## What's deliberately not here

- **No generated answers.** A question with no card gets the nearest cards and an "ask for a card" link that opens a GitHub issue. That issue stream is the gap log for `OPEN-RESEARCH.md`.
- **No podcast quotations.** Transcripts are pointers, not proof.
- **No copyrighted text.** The KJV and the held public-domain files only.

## Deploy

`.github/workflows/site.yml` builds on every push to `main` that touches `site/`, `questions/`, or `christianity/`, and deploys `site/dist/` to GitHub Pages. Pages must be set to "GitHub Actions" as the source (Settings → Pages). A custom domain is a CNAME away when there is one.

Phase 2 (a smarter drawer: embeddings over the cards and the whole repo, still returning cards only) and phase 3 (grounded answers for questions with no card, stamped UNCHECKED) are described in `projects/the-nazarene-way/STATUS.md` on Matt's side and are gated on `FIX-LIST.md` P0.
